# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-11)

**Core value:** Every risk score and every cascade the system shows is backed by real data and a measured, reproducible evaluation. Nothing fabricated is ever presented as analysis.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Secure & Honest Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Secure & Honest Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-11 - Roadmap created for milestone v1.0 Lean MVP (6 phases, 33/33 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Six horizontal-layer phases (foundation, engineering, data, detection, dashboard, deploy); research confirmed, no phases added
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 both depend only on Phase 2 and may run in parallel; Phase 5 needs both
- [Roadmap]: Bluesky Jetstream v2 is the propagation source (confirm in the Phase 3 spike); primary UX is a triage feed plus a "score this text" playground, not query-driven `/analyze`
- [Roadmap]: v2 "Showcase" items stay deferred with no phases; git-history purge of the rotated GNews key is not in any phase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Bluesky data-use terms, live-tail cascade yield and repost/quote record shapes are unverified; the DATA-01 spike must settle them before the schema migration
- [Phase 3]: Owner decisions needed on retention policy for stored text and on merging cascades when a provisional root resolves later
- [Phase 3]: The fate of the legacy query-driven `/analyze` (retire or serve stored news context) must be settled to satisfy DATA-06
- [Phase 6]: Render RAM and cold start, and Neon pooler behaviour with psycopg, are untested; GitHub Actions scheduled jobs are disabled after 60 days of repo inactivity

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:
